## Automated Testing 

### HTML 
All **HTML** code was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) 
regularly during the development process. **The HTML Source Code** was regularly viewed for each page 
using **Chrome Developer Tools** (right click, *Inspect*) and passed through the 
[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).  
Various minor errors were encountered and corrected during the final **HTML** validation check. 
All HTML code now passes validation with no errors or warnings. See [HTML Validation Reports](media/testing/validation/html).

### CSS
Custom CSS from [base.css](static/css/base.css), [profile.css](profiles/static/profiles/css/profile.css) and [checkout.css](checkout/static/checkout/css/checkout.css) was validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).  
No errors were generated.

### JavaScript

### Python
Pylint was used to verify **Python** code. Any errors were corrected and re-run until correct. In some cases, where linting errors were erroneous or unavoidable these were suppressed. Files generated by django and unit tests were ignored.

### Python Unit Tests

Automated unit tests were created to ensure correct functioning of various components. These include the app database models, views, forms and signal functions.
To perform automated testing, from the project root directory type:
`>python3 manage.py test`
