Although really matt, the spray's original formula retains the metallic shine from metallic paints such as Plate Mail.\nAlways let any Quickshade dry for a minimum of 48 hours before using this varnish, and apply it in a thin coat. Never spray in humid conditions or cold weather. Test on a spare model first before spraying the whole army.\n",

Professional model painters always work with a wet brush and dilute the paint with water or Matt Medium, applying many thin layers to achieve depth and shadows. Colours may also be diluted with other Mediums  for glazes and layered applications.\nModel Color paints are presented in plastic bottles of 17ml with an eyedropper device which keeps paint from drying and prevents spills. 8 Metallic colours (in alcohol base) are presented in childproof bottles of 35 ml.\n",

The Model Color range has been formulated with permanent pigments for fine arts; all colours are completely lightfast and opaque, (with the exception of the fluorescent and transparent colours, which are semi-opaque).

The Model Color range has been formulated with permanent pigments for fine arts; all colours are completely lightfast and opaque, (with the exception of the fluorescent and transparent colours, which are semi-opaque). A few metallic pigments (in an alcohol base) are included in the range, since these give a harder brilliance than the water based metallics.\nThe consistency of the Model Color range allows for an extremely smooth and uniform coverage, with no trace of brushstrokes. Professional model painters always work with a wet brush and dilute the paint with water or Matt Medium, applying many thin layers to achieve depth and shadows. Colours may also be diluted with other Mediums  for glazes and layered applications.\nModel Color paints are presented in plastic bottles of 17ml with an eyedropper device which keeps paint from drying and prevents spills. 8 Metallic colours (in alcohol base) are presented in childproof bottles of 35 ml.\n",

The colours have been chosen with the help and advice of the best model painters from many countries. The Model Color range has been formulated with permanent pigments for fine arts; all colours are completely lightfast and opaque, (with the exception of the fluorescent and transparent colours, which are semi-opaque). A few metallic pigments (in an alcohol base) are included in the range, since these give a harder brilliance than the water based metallics.\nThe consistency of the Model Color range allows for an extremely smooth and uniform coverage, with no trace of brushstrokes. Professional model painters always work with a wet brush and dilute the paint with water or Matt Medium, applying many thin layers to achieve depth and shadows. Colours may also be diluted with other Mediums  for glazes and layered applications.\nModel Color paints are presented in plastic bottles of 17ml with an eyedropper device which keeps paint from drying and prevents spills. 8 Metallic colours (in alcohol base) are presented in childproof bottles of 35 ml.\n",

The colours have been chosen with the help and advice of the best model painters from many countries. The Model Color range has been formulated with permanent pigments for fine arts; all colours are completely lightfast and opaque, (with the exception of the fluorescent and transparent colours, which are semi-opaque). A few metallic pigments (in an alcohol base) are included in the range, since these give a harder brilliance than the water based metallics.\nThe consistency of the Model Color range allows for an extremely smooth and uniform coverage, with no trace of brushstrokes. Professional model painters always work with a wet brush and dilute the paint with water or Matt Medium, applying many thin layers to achieve depth and shadows. Colours may also be diluted with other Mediums  for glazes and layered applications.\nModel Color paints are presented in plastic bottles of 17ml with an eyedropper device which keeps paint from drying and prevents spills. 8 Metallic colours (in alcohol base) are presented in childproof bottles of 35 ml.\n",

The colours have been chosen with the help and advice of the best model painters from many countries. The Model Color range has been formulated with permanent pigments for fine arts; all colours are completely lightfast and opaque, (with the exception of the fluorescent and transparent colours, which are semi-opaque). A few metallic pigments (in an alcohol base) are included in the range, since these give a harder brilliance than the water based metallics.\nThe consistency of the Model Color range allows for an extremely smooth and uniform coverage, with no trace of brushstrokes. Professional model painters always work with a wet brush and dilute the paint with water or Matt Medium, applying many thin layers to achieve depth and shadows. Colours may also be diluted with other Mediums  for glazes and layered applications.\nModel Color paints are presented in plastic bottles of 17ml with an eyedropper device which keeps paint from drying and prevents spills. 8 Metallic colours (in alcohol base) are presented in childproof bottles of 35 ml.\n",
